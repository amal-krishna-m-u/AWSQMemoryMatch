# AWS Q Memory Match Online - Gameplay Scenario

Game Setup:
Player A (Alice) decides to host a game. She goes to the game's website, clicks "Create Room", and gets a unique room ID: AWSQ123.
Alice shares this ID with Player B (Bob) and Player C (Charlie) through their group chat.
Bob and Charlie join the room by entering AWSQ123 in the "Join Room" section.

Gameplay:

1. Starting the Game:
   Once all players are in the room, Alice starts the game.
   The screen displays a grid of cards, all face down, with AWS and Q Developer themed icons.
2. Turn-Based Play:
   The game begins with Alice. She clicks on two cards, revealing:
   One card shows an S3 icon.
   Another reveals a Q Developer icon for "Code Suggestions".
   These cards don’t match, so they flip back after a few seconds.
3. Next Player's Turn:
   It’s now Bob’s turn. He selects:
   An EC2 card.
   Another EC2 card.
   They match!
   A pop-up or sidebar shows a brief explanation about EC2 instances, and Bob earns 2 points for the match.
4. Educational Content:
   When Charlie matches cards for AWS Lambda and a Q Developer feature related to Lambda functions, the game displays:
   "AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Amazon Q can help generate Lambda function code!"
   Charlie gets 2 points for the match.
5. Scoring System:
   Points: Each match grants points. Matching AWS services with their corresponding Q Developer features might give bonus points for educational synergy.
   Score Tracking: The score is displayed on the screen for all players to see, updating in real-time after each match. For example:
   Alice: 4 points
   Bob: 6 points
   Charlie: 8 points
6. Game Progression:
   Players take turns until all cards are matched.
   The game may have levels or rounds where new sets of cards with different AWS or Q Developer themes are introduced.
7. End Game:
   Once all cards are matched, the game declares a winner based on points. If there's a tie, perhaps a quick quiz on the content revealed during the game decides the winner.
   Results are shown:
   Winner: Charlie with 20 points.
   Alice and Bob are commended for their efforts, with their scores shown.
8. Post-Game Interaction:
   Players can choose to play again, start a new room with different themes, or review the educational content they've unlocked.
